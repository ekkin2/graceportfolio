## Rules
- **Code Conciseness**: Minimize line count while maintaining complete functionality. Write efficient, compact code. Willing to tradeoff readability in excahnge for code compactness and minimal line numbers 
- **No Comments**: Do not add comments when writing code. Code should be self-explanatory.
- **Simplicity First**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones. Avoid over-engineering.
- **UI Quality**: Focus on aesthetic and responsive UI. Ensure components work well across different screen sizes and maintain visual consistency with the app's design system. 
- **Compactness**: Bias towards keeping UI components compact, maximizing what can fit on the page. 
- **Component Organization**: Bias towards not creating new component files. Only extract to a separate file if the component is used (or can be used) in more than 3 files. Otherwise, keep components inline in the file where they're used, especially if only used in one file. Still abstract into components for clarity, just keep them in the same file.
